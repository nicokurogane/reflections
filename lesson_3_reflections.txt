When do you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- When i start a new project or get a project to mantain it 
  so i can keep track of changes.

- When i see fit to keep a backup of documents and they will change
  every now and then.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

to stay up-to-date with meaningful changes in the local repository


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

 forks copy a repository in github to your github account. clone copies
a repository indcate to your local computer and branches creates a commit 
but it's not public to the master branch.

You want to fork when you want a copy of a repository on your github.
you want to clone when you want a copy of a repository where you can
commit changes on your computer and you want to create a branch when
you want a commit to be present but not visible on the master branch. 


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    you can check if the master branch in your github repository
    have been update if you were disconnected a while, and
    if that was the case, then you can check if any important file
    has been altered.
